### Hi there 👋

- ✨ My several years of experience include working on many diverse projects, such as complex web applications, browser and mobile games, scrapers, and deobfuscators.
- 🚢 I can translate ideas into comprehensive solutions. _Just ship it!_
- 📖 I am constantly seeking new challenges and keeping up with the latest trends in web development, therefore I am familiar with tools like `React Server Components`, `Bun`, or `Vite`.
- 💻 Currently, I work at [Prown](https://prown.app/) as a full-stack developer, focusing primarily on the development of a dashboard in [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). We use modern stack, including [React Query](https://github.com/TanStack/query), [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc), [React Hook Form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form), [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod), and many more.
- 🐉 Co-founder of [Mistwood](https://mistwood.pl/en), a browser game inspired by Nightwood with over 5k players.
- 🎓 Graduate of Computer Science at [Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology](https://www.pja.edu.pl/en/).
